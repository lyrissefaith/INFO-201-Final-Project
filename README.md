# INFO-201-Final-Project

Executive Summary: ½-1page (GitHub readme)
We aim to explore whether states with larger populations influence obesity rates. Our objective is to establish a connection between obesity percentages and population numbers, providing a comprehensive perspective. By compiling a dataset that integrates obesity percentages and state population data, we intend to identify patterns and trends in the USA, examining how population size relates to obesity. Additionally, we will investigate regional variations to determine if the state's location correlates with the percentage of the population that is obese. The datasets we are utilizing can be accessed on Data.gov, State of Childhood Obesity, and the United States Census Bureau. We are primarily focused on the time period of 2015 - 2022 to look for any possible trends. This intentional decision was made to concentrate on relevant and recent periods. Our target audience for our data spans across professionals and citizens. Mainly, our audience are public health officials and/or health conscious citizens who are interested in the state of America’s obesity percentages in relation to state and population, as America is viewed as more obese compared to foreign counterparts. We are interested to see if states with higher populations, or political positions affect obesity numbers. We wanted to add the connection between obesity numbers and population numbers to put it into perspective.

Graph 7: Relationship between Obesity & Population Growth Rate (% rate)

We created this graph to show the relationship between obesity and population growth rate by percentage growth rate. We can see there is a small upward trend between the growth rates, with higher obesity growth rate corresponding to a higher population growth rate.
